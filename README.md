# Weather_API
This project was a fantastic experience, allowing me to delve deep into using APIs and enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, bootstrap.

Highlights of the Weather App:

-🌍 Fetches real-time weather data for any location using the Weather API.

-📅 Displays current, tomorrow's, and the day after tomorrow's weather forecasts.

-🔄 Auto-updates based on the user's geolocation or searched location.

-📱 Fully responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
